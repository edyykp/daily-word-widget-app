# Components

This directory contains reusable UI components that can be used across the application.

## Structure

- Each component should be in its own folder
- Include component file, styles, types, and tests
- Example: `Button/Button.tsx`, `Button/Button.styles.ts`, `Button/Button.types.ts`

## Best Practices

- Keep components small and focused
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Extract styles to separate files when needed
- Make components reusable and configurable via props
