# Screens

This directory contains screen-level components that represent full pages/views in the app.

## Structure

- Each screen should be in its own folder
- Include screen component, styles, and related logic
- Example: `HomeScreen/HomeScreen.tsx`, `HomeScreen/HomeScreen.styles.ts`

## Best Practices

- Screens should primarily compose components
- Keep business logic in hooks or services
- Use navigation props for screen-specific navigation
