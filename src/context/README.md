# Context

This directory contains React Context providers for global state management.

## When to Use

- Global app state (theme, user, settings)
- State that needs to be accessed by many components
- Alternative to Redux for simpler state needs

## Best Practices

- Keep contexts focused and separate concerns
- Use multiple contexts instead of one large context
- Consider using a state management library (Redux, Zustand) for complex apps
