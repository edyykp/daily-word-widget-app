# Hooks

This directory contains custom React hooks for reusable logic.

## Examples

- `useAuth.ts` - Authentication state and methods
- `useApi.ts` - API data fetching with loading/error states
- `useDebounce.ts` - Debounce utility hook
- `useStorage.ts` - Local storage operations

## Best Practices

- Follow React hooks naming convention (use\*)
- Keep hooks focused on a single concern
- Return objects for multiple values, arrays for ordered pairs
